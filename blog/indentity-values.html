        <p>
    <Strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved
        in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</Strong><br>

   My ethical values are trustworthiness, honesty,respect and responsibility. I always work around these values and it
   made me feel self acutalization and highest level of psychological development. 
   Situation: I was working at Axis Bank india in 2017 and Indian government has announced demonetization. people need to
   exchange their old currency with the new legal tendor currency. one of our old customer called me and asked me to come
   at his place after work. I thought it is for general query so i went there place. They have plenty of hard cash with them
   at home because in india people used hard cash for tehir daily transactions and digital wyas are very less in practise.
   So they offered me money to get exchange their currency in differental intervals so that my seniors and bank wouldn't know
   about it. I could do it choosing money over my values but i refused their offer. 

   But as they are our old customer maintain good relationship with bank and me. I have advised them to do it in a legal way.
   It would take long time but by opening new accounts of family members you can exchange their money in the prescribed thrashhold 
   limit set by government. they were agreed with my decision and advise. we worked on it and it succecced. I have retained good customer
   of bank and retained my values too.

    Indian culture and traditions are something which has now become renowned all across the world.The Namaskar of Sat Sri Akal is not only
    dedicated to the memory of God the Truth, but also directs us towards good actions and to follow nothing but the Truth which saves us from
    all evils. We indians have optimastic behaviour which gives us encourgement and positive vibes to do new and challenging tasks.
 
    Touching feet of elders:In india Younger show great respect to their elders.we touch feet of our elders everyday after waking up and especially
    on festive occasions or before starting an important work. this build respect value in us.
 
    In inidan culture we have different religions and we celebrate religious festivals each other. we have large diverse culture and lot many languages
    but because we belive in sharing, it makes us good in building relationships among strangers.</p>

    My biggest strength at workplace or any platform is Adaptive to change/quick learner. other than this I am multi tasker and good in Interpersonal skills
    that always help me while i worked in teams.
    Limitations in me like I wasn't read books but i have started slowly and keep working on it. As IT is new industry for me and i am not good in programming

    <strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
        Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</strong><br>


   I got promoteded on my first job and with new role i got transfered to new location. it was transition from Rural branch to Urban location. target customers
   were different and even branch team and bussiness aprroach were different. I used my strengths to work over there and it worked for me. other strategies I would 
   try this time educate more and more customers about new digital ways of banking by making small teams and target group of customers. This way Bank can make 
   good business.
