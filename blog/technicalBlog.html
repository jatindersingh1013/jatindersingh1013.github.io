    <h1><strong>Differences between Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning</strong></h1>
<Body>
    <p><strong>I am fairly new to web design, and haven’t mastered the differences in positioning of elements.
         I know there is absolute, fixed, and relative. Are there any others? Also, do they majorly differ? And when should you use which?</strong></p>

    <p>An important concept to understand first is that every single element on a web page is a block. Literally a rectangle of pixels.
         This is easy to understand when you set the element to display: block; or if that element is block-level by default like a (div). 
         This means you can set a width and a height and that element will respect that. But elements that are display: inline;, like a (span) 
         by default, are also rectangles, they just flow onto the page differently, lining up horizontally as they can.<br>

        Now that you are picturing every single page element as a block of pixels, we can talk about how positioning is used to
         get the blocks of pixels exactly where you want them to go.
        </p><br>

</p>
    <p><strong>Relative</strong></p>

    <p>This type of positioning is probably the most confusing and misused. What it really means is “relative to itself”. 
        If you set position: relative; on an element but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), it will
         have no effect on it’s positioning at all, it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as position: static; But if
          you do give it some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift its position 10 pixels down from where
           it would normally be. I’m sure you can imagine, the ability to shift an element around based on its regular position is 
           pretty useful. I find myself using this to line up form elements many times that have a tendency to not want to line up how I want them to.<br>

        There are two other things that happen when you set position: relative; on an element that you should be aware of. One is that 
        it introduces the ability to use z-index on that element, which doesn’t work with statically positioned elements. Even if you 
        don’t set a z-index value, this element will now appear on top of any other statically positioned element. You can’t fight it 
        by setting a higher z-index value on a statically positioned element.<br>
        
        The other thing that happens is it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any element that is a child of the
         relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block. This brings up some powerful opportunities which 
         I talk about here.</p><br>


    
    <p><strong>Absolute</strong></p>

    <p>
        This is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. You use 
        the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right to set the location. Remember that these values will be relative to the next
         parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the
          (html) element itself meaning it will be placed relative to the page itself.<br>

The trade-off (and most important thing to remember) about absolute positioning is that these elements are removed from the flow of elements
 on the page. An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesn’t affect other elements. This is a serious
  thing to consider every time you use absolute positioning. Its overuse or improper use can limit the flexibility of your site.</p><br>

  <p><strong>Fixed</strong></p>

  <p>
    A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn’t change when the window is 
    scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled.This might be used for something like a navigation
     bar that you want to remain visible at all times regardless of the pages scroll position.
     The concern with fixed positioning is that it can cause situations where the fixed element overlaps content such that is is inaccessible. 
     The trick is having enough space to avoid
