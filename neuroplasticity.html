        <h1><strong>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</strong></h1>
        <h2><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                neuroplasticity : Its psychology refers to change in brain capacity to evolve or adapt things according to our envirnorment
                around us. Not only in childhood but in our adulthood a human brain going through the phase of growth and building of new neurons.
                It is continous process that happen when we make new interactions and try to learn , adapt new things and even it works for patients
                who are suffering from some disease. It enhances our existing cognitive capabilities. I would say with the help of neuroplasticity
                one can chnage the way of thinking and develop new minset by adding new skills and abilities.

                <strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Practice more and more, Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, continous learning of new things and train my brain to 
                adpat new learnings and storing it all in my brain and calling it when it required. it would help me to reshape my brain and 
                add new things in it. I would prepare my brain to make use of plasticity by changing my think process of trying new experiments
                with it.

                        our brain to start again .</Li>

                    <li>Prioritize an exercise routine. It would call physical side of neuroplasticity</li>
                
                    <li>Make  mental health a priority. I would induldge myslelf to react in new environment and  it will help me decrease
                        stress and depression.</li>

            <h2><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></h2>
        <p>
            <strong>what is Growth mindset and why it is relevant?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Growth Mindset says skills and intelligence can be improved with effort and persistence. People with a growth mindset
            face new and difficult challenges, being tough in the face of difficulties,can add new learning in their life.we can 
            develop growth mindset with hard work,decication and with some kind of inspiration which gives us reason to get out of
            comfort zone and set mind to learn new.<br><br>

            <strong>why it is relevant:</strong> A growth mindset is an extremely valuable skill to have, as it gives motivation to work 
            hard and dedication to improve  mental and physical abilities. Growth mindset can take failure as an opportunity and challenges
            help them to grow.

            <strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            yes it is surprising for me to know that how important is to train our mindset. because every person have both state 
            of mind fixed mindset and growth mindset. It depends on us that how we train our mind so that it can work on growth, 
            accept and store new things in it.I got motivated with this topic and start working on my mind to tarin it for growth
            Mindset.I would stop thinking of what could go wrong rather I would start focus on what could go right. I come to know
            that my efforts and attitude determine my abilities.
        </p>

            <strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong>
        </p>
    <div>  
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> I would say listen to the mindset voice inside of mine that i want to add new skillset here and keep encourage myself
                    to try it several times.
                </li>
                <li>Keep push myself to change “failing” with “learning.”and being failed takes an opportunity to learn more.

                </li>
                <li>Breaking a problem into parts and try to set and accomplish small aim inorder to hit ultimate goal of learning coding
                    as subject.
                </li>
            </ul>
