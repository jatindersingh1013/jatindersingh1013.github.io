        <h1><strong>Problem-Solving</strong></h1>

            </p><strong>-Got blocked on a simple problem</strong></p>

            <p> I was stuck many times during the sprint but I need to explain one problem which was simple but I need to use problem
                solving technique to get it solve. so while doing manipulating the objects task in kata, I got stuck on 14 test which says
                "adam.children === terah.children".<br>
                Techniques I have used for it is first "try somthing" give same name to the properties but it
                didn't work for me. after that i used "reading error message" tecnique to solve it but i couldn't actual match the things then
                I use "asking peer for help" technique of problem solving and i got idea from slack channel that ("Think about how you made the
                object adam be equal to terah.spouse earlier in the exercise. It's a similar solution.") then I got idea and I have succeed.
            </p><br>

            </p><strong>-Solved a problem in an elegant way.</strong></p>

            <p>
                when I was doing super FizzBuzz code in kata exercise and I was finished with fizzbuzz task but Couldn't get idea
                to crack code for Super FizzBuzz. I go to the sample solution file to understand it. By looking into that i thought
                how can i do it in another way means make code shorter. I have approached my facilitator to please explain sample solution
                and ask her how we can short code. I had thought lets not make another arry and call it. we can do it with old given arry
                and given FizzBuzz function. she helped me in that and we made it in elegant way.
            </p><br>
            
            <P><strong>-Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</strong></P>
            <p><strong>Pseudocode</strong></p>
            <p>
                Pseudocoding is very helpful in coding because rather than jump directly into writing code i use this technique to
                go through the problem and divide parts of it and write pseudo code in simple language that help me to write code.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></p>
            <p>
                I wasn't familiar with the name of this technique before this but I have used it many times in my life not only at academic
                channel but even on workplace when I read things again and again and try to understand what statement is saying.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Reading error messages</strong></p>
                this technique kind of getting direction for me. read error mesg help me that i have syntax erroe or what is expected from
                code to do. sometimes this give me idea of think in different way.
            <p><strong>Console.logging</strong></p>
            <p>
                Console.log method is used to call function , variale or array to understand what code is doing. I don't use much console.log 
                but it helps us to see how code will show up when cosole.log it.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Googling</strong></p>
                <p>
                    As I am beginner in coding language and google is best tool or technique for me to use and I have used it alot throughout
                    every sprint. Google is very vast and I always got many answers of my problems some are complex to understand but again I have
                    to choose which is more clear and concise to understand.
                </p>
            <p><strong>Trying something</strong></p>
            <p>
                this would  be a good technique later on for me to try different ways of writing code when i will be more efficient
                in coding. Although I have tried this in my problem but I don't know how right I was there.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></p>
            <p>
                I am using this technique of problem solving in my learning journey and it has worked for me fewtimes but most of
                the time things go over the head because everyone understanding is different and when different people gave some hints
                it didn't worked everytime. but I still find it  useful tool as it broadens the scope of solving a issue.because when 
                people work together ideas will comeup.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></p>
            <p>
                This is ofcourse a good problem sokving method that I am using it as much as I can in my learning because they have
                experience and better understanding than the asking from student who is struggling like me. Coaches understand my 
                problem in better way and gave me direction of how things can be do better.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></p>
            <p>
                Reflection always help me to self critisize my idea of thinking and doing things. like what i have did wrong in past
                and what I shouldn't repeat this time to overcome it. I always do self assessment to see what is my understanding after
                completing one exercise. It gives clarity of my strength and area of improvement.
