        <h1><strong>Foundations Reflection</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></p>

        <p>
            I have learnt and feel the power of emotional intelligence behind every success.<br>
	        Being focused<br>
            Positive attitude is the key to make things happen which I learnt from the topic Neuroplasticity and growth mindset.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Your values won’t make you to stop.<br>
            Self awareness tells you where you actually are in terms of learning and capable of doing something.<br>
            Empathy makes you a  good listener and share things with fellow students, I have made good relations with fellow cohorts while code discussion.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I feel enlightened after learning topics under it. I get to know more about myself and feel like I can accomplish 
            hardest things with positive mindset and how to managing emotions specially when you’re blocked.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I learnt the importance of core learning and implementing nowadays however sometimes its challenging like you say 
            you will not get panic when you not answered but I feel big change in me by researching about the topic instead 
            thinking of getting answer by someone. Core learning is something that would get enhanced by the time.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a 
            web development bootcamp course?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I believe its to make perfect balance between extensive course and how you’re coping with it. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Not at all, I do believe in meditation and yoga likewise it, core learning is a healthy meal to our brain.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></p>
        <p>
            I found core learning quite interesting as I have given fair answers in every reflection related to it.
