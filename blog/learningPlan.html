        <h1><strong>Learning Plan Bootcamp</strong></h1>
        <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
        <p>
            My long term plan is to get settle with a good IT web development or An automation tester job and excel my 
            skills by each passing year. , I also want to try some product domain like banking or cards and payments as 
            i love numbers and have good experience in same. I believe technical and Product knowledge would be an excellent 
            combination to be a successful developer.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I have learned so much from foundations program of dev academy. My biggest strength is always a learning attitude 
            and topics like growth mindset and emotional intelligence has changed my thinking process when i was in uncomfortable 
            zone during foundation. I am coming from non technical background and now i know basics of coding language which became 
            my strength now and I have learned problem solving techniques which i ll be definitely use on my bootcamp journey. 
            Limitation would be my skills in pseudocoding. I still have to work on it as it is very important to breakdown code 
            in normal human language and write code from it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Public speaking will be my biggest challenge as i am bit introvert person however I’m very good at interpersonal skills. 
            Working with team and making great communication were part of past my work experience.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I would like to work on public speaking in order to get assure if my ideas are communicating well with others and also, would like 
            to develop leadership skills to stay ahead and take initiative to solve any hindrance.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong></p>
        <p>
            To get answered when I really need it or immediately if possible.<br>
            Do not underestimate the capabilities of student if he/she doesn’t understanding code sometimes.<br>
            Expecting respect and courage of any raised question or concerns.<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</strong></p>
        <p>
            I have made my mind to focus and use most of my time of 7 days in week on learning..learning and executing things.
            I am a strong commitment person, never leave my things halfway.<br>
            From foundations, i already have made good relations with few fellow students that we are answering and questioning 
            comfortably. This type of attitude will help me while pairing with any student in future.<br>
            With facilitator, I believe honest feedback and answers will help to manage<br>
        </p>

<body>
    <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong><br>

        I want to become Software developer.</p>
        <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong><br>

            My biggest strength  is Adaptive to change/quick learner. other than this I am multi tasker,  good in Interpersonal skills and attention to details in relation to learning.
            Limitations in relation to learning is that I don't like just reading way of learning over that i like to watch videos and find solutions through search engines. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br>

            Inter-personal skills, sharing knowledge and ideas, helping each other, building relationships.
        </p>
        <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</strong><br>

            I will try to go with the flow of course and complete required tasks within the timeframe assinged. I am using toggle track to tarck my each activity everyday. if things start to 
            build up, i will ask for help from others if stuck or share details with my facilitator so that things will get better for me and I would complete things on time.</p>
        <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong><br>

            I will seek help where I cannot find the solution by myself. I will either ask  team in foundations or my facilitator.
        </p>
        <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong><br>

            A good welcoming and encouraging behaviour that help me to learn more and not to hesitate while stuck. Collaborating learning can be achieved with the guidance of a facilitator.
            </p>
        <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</strong><br>

            I have little son and i need to drop and pick him everyday but timings are outside my learing schedule. I am not working anywhere till bootcamp end so my all dedication towrads learning web 
            development
