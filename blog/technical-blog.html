<Body>
    <p><strong>What is Lifecycle?</strong></p>

    <p>Lifecycle in the simple term refers to the sequence of changes from one form to other forms.
    These changes can happen to any tangible or intangible things. Every entity has a lifecycle from its inception to retire / demise.<br>
    
    In a similar fashion, Software is also an entity. Just like developing software involves a sequence of steps,
    testing also has steps which should be executed in a definite sequence.<br>
    
    This phenomenon of executing the testing activities in a systematic and planned way is called testing life cycle.

    <p><strong>What Is Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?</strong></p>

    <p>Software Testing Life Cycle refers to a testing process which has specific steps to be executed in a definite sequence to ensure that the quality goals have been met. 
    In the STLC process, each activity is carried out in a planned and systematic way. Each phase has different goals and deliverables.
    Different organizations have different phases in STLC; however, the basis remains the same.
</p><br>
    
    <p>Below are the phases of STLC:<br>
    <ol>
<li>Requirements phase</li>
<li>Planning Phase</li>
<li>Analysis phase</li>
<li>Design Phase</li>
<li>Implementation Phase</li>
<li>Execution Phase</li>
<li>Conclusion Phase</li>
<li>Closure Phase</li>
    </ol>
