        <h1><strong>JavaScript-DOM</strong></h1>

        <p><STRONG>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</STRONG><br>

            I would explian this with an example of car. car chassis or vehicle frame is like HTML who supports main structure of the
            motor vechicle to which basic function of car attched. It got basic functions like got space for all elements that we
            can attch later to it. we work on it to make it functional like adding body parts, lights, brakes, radiator and so on.
        
            Now CSS is like giving styling to car model. It includes painting, vinyaling, tinting of windows, add spolier and roof rails,
            put fancy seat covers. its like giviing apperance to the basic structure to make it look better.   </p>

        <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing
             your teeth'. (But not those ones).</strong><br>
            
            Control flow is process oriented approach like computer executes statements in order from first line to last line.Real times
            example I would relate from everyday life is plan for my everyday activities in control flow and then work on excution of
            each activity. what I will  do and by what time I will complete that activity to complete full chart flow of activities.<br>

            Loops for me in real life is an activity that repeats until reach satisfied condition, For example : eating lunch,
            we eat until we full or satisfied. we should have purpose, condition and cycle define in loop to work until the condition
            fulfilled.
        </p>

        
        <p><STRONG>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</STRONG><br>  
                DOM(Document Object Model ) is the platform where we can access and change elements of HTML and CSS. with DOM programmers
                can build documents, add modify and delete elmeents or content of it. it can make changes to the structure of HTML and
                styling of CSS.<br>

                I would relate this to my previous example of HTML nad CSS car manufacturing. Imagine car assembly line manufacturing platform
                which includes work flow of activities. assembly line structure as a whole is DOM where engineers can access structure of car 
                and styling of it aswell. one activity repeat several times till the time it passed and them moves to next flow to  make final 
                product.In the assembly line which is root of the manufacturing process engineeers able to see each element of the car making
                process.
        </p>
        

            
        
           <p><STRONG>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</STRONG><br>

           Arrays is to access multiple things, example list of items from Grocery list. Arrays defines within the square bracket '[]'
           For example : var items = ['sugar','flour','pulses']. items in Array are classified in index which starts from [0,1,2 and so on] 
           we can access by calling items and the position in [] bracket according to the index position of item inside array<br><br>


           Objecs is to access using name, the name that represents its characteristics and start with keyword 'let'.<br>
           For example : <br>
           let buildingType ={ <br>
            type1 :townhouse, <br>
            type2 :duplex<br>
           }<br>
            objct can be called by putting (.) between object name and parameter of the object.<br>
           
           buildingType.type1
        </p>  
        

        <p><STRONG>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</STRONG><br>
Function is sequence set of commands that can be called by other function, is organised and having feature like reusability 
that means function can be used many times when required. Keyword 'Return' is used to return the value of the function.<br>
Calling function example would be : Boiled Veggies, a big bowl of veggies are boiled in the morning that can be used for the
afternoon sandwitch and dinner's salad.
