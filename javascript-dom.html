        <h1><strong>JavaScript-DOM</strong></h1>

        <p><STRONG>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</STRONG><br>

        I would say for me Html is like Normal Species of cat and CSS is Jaguar which is powerful and enhanced version
             of cat. you can say jaguar takes more attention over normal cat species but it still a part of them. they are
              both interlinked because of same species.</p>

        <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing
             your teeth'. (But not those ones).</strong><br>
           
           Control flow for me is to engage in a activity to perform better like excercising or doing Gym which i like the
                most. Imporved when i do by the time.
            Loops for me in real life is an activity that repeats until reach satisfied condition, For example : eating lunch,
             we eat until we full or satisfied.

        <div>
            <p><STRONG>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</STRONG><br>  
        
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML
             document as a tree structure where every object is like stem of the tree, its root is HTML, branches are the
              elements, bark is different types of text and leaves are the element defination.
            </p>

        </div>
           <p><STRONG>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</STRONG><br>

           Arrays is to access multiple things, example list of items from Grocery list and objects are access the specific
                ones that can be defined by set of characteristics like a character from a game.
        </p>

        <p><STRONG>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</STRONG><br>

        It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number
             of small and manageable functions. Like any other advanced programming language, JavaScript also supports all the
              features necessary to write modular code using functions.<br>

             A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
            Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).<br>
            The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:<strong>(parameter1, parameter2, ...)</strong><br>
            The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}</p>
