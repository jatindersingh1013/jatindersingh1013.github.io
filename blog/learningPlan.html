<h1><strong>Learning Plan</strong></h1>
<body>
    <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong><br>

        I want to become web designer and development or Software programmer.</p>
        <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong><br>

            My biggest strength  is Adaptive to change/quick learner. other than this I am multi tasker,  good in Interpersonal skills and attention to details in relation to learning.
            Limitations in relation to learning is that I don't like just reading way of learning over that i like to watch videos and find solutions through search engines. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br>

            Inter-personal skills, sharing knowledge and ideas, helping each other, building relationships.
        </p>
        <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</strong><br>

            I will try to go with the flow of course and complete required tasks within the timeframe assinged. I am using toggle track to tarck my each activity everyday. if things start to 
            build up, i will ask for help from others if stuck or share details with my facilitator so that things will get better for me and I would complete things on time.</p>
        <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong><br>

            I will seek help where I cannot find the solution by myself. I will either ask  team in foundations or my facilitator.
        </p>
        <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong><br>

            A good welcoming and encouraging behaviour that help me to learn more and not to hesitate while stuck. Collaborating learning can be achieved with the guidance of a facilitator.
            </p>
        <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</strong><br>

            I have little son and i need to drop and pick him everyday but timings are outside my learing schedule. I am not working anywhere till bootcamp end so my all dedication towrads learning web 
            development
